1. Find the average score

Sequence:
Get all the individual scores
Add all the scores provided and get a total score
Divide the total score by the total number of exams and get the average score
Display the average score to the screen

Variables required:
totalScore
averageScore
exams


Pseudocode:
exams = exam1 + exam2 ...
totalScore = score1 + score2 + ... + score10

averageScore = totalScore/10

display averageScore

Test 1:
exam1 = 20, exam2 = 10, exam3 = 5;
exams= 3;
totalScore = 20 + 10 + 5
totalScore = 35
averageScore = 35 / 3
averageScore = 11.6

Test 2:

exam1 = 7, exam2 = 13
exams = 2
totalScore = 7 + 13
totalScore = 20
averageScore = 20/2
averageScore = 10





2. How much water runs off the roof

Sequence:
Convert dimensions of footprint of the roof to inches
Multiply the dimensions in inches by the inches of rainfall
Then divide that result by 231 to get the amount of gallons
Display the amount of gallons

Variables required:
roofDimension1
roofDimension2
totalInches
rainfallInches
runoff

Pseudocode: 
totalInches = (roofDimension1 * 12) * (roofDimension2 * 12) * rainfallInches

runoff = totalInches / 231

Display runoff

Test 1:
roofDimension1 = 50, roofDimension2 = 20,  rainfallInches = 1;
totalInches = (50 * 12) * (20 * 12) * 1
totalInches = 600 * 240 * 1
totalInches = 144,000
runoff = 144,000 / 231
runoff = 623.38


Test 2: 
roofDimension1 = 25, roofDimension2 = 37,  rainfallInches = 1.2;
totalInches = (25 * 12) * (37 * 12) * 1.2
totalInches = 300 * 444 * 1.2
totalInches = 159,840
runoff = 159,840 / 231
runoff = 691.95
